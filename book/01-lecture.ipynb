In 1715, Brooke Taylor developed a way to represent a function as an infinite series of derivatives of that function. In 1850, William Rankine worked out a few laws of thermodynamics, which enabled us to describe how energy could be added to the mix. Finally, in 1822, Claude-Louis Navier and, later in 1850, George Stokes together produced what we now call the continuity and momentum equations. Mix in a few principles from chemistry, and all we need now is a way to solve this complex system of equations.\n",

    "Back when these equations were first written down, the scientists of the day could not find any complete solutions to these equations. What they could do was slice off terms, hoping to get to a point where they could solve something. They had some success in this work, and many of the simplified techniques they developed helped power the evolution of flying vehicles. \n",

    "Eventually, mathematicians, including Isaac Newton, worked on representing the derivatives of a function as an infinite series of simple terms - and the *finite difference* was born. That allowed them to take extremely complex differential equations and *approximate* them with algebraic equations. There was some hope we could solve those, but the calculations would be tough to do. Grinding through the calculations was going to take a *long* time. Also, in working with these approximate equations, we introduced errors in the solutions. We would need to study those errors to decide if we liked the answers we were getting!\n",

    "Seymore Cray got tired of working for CDC, and took several of the engineers with him to form *Cray Research\". Seymore designed a new machine that was designed for serious number crunching. Instead of setting up a simple two-number-adding device, he designed one that added two sets of 64 numbers together all at the same time. This was called a vector machine. He used some clever tricks to make his system go faster, one called pipelining, which broke up a single long-running operation into a sequence of steps, each running quickly. More input data could be loaded into the first stage since, as soon as the first stage was complete, it could accent new input rather than waiting until all stages were completed. \n",

    "If we mix in some AI, we can probably figure out how to actually work only where we need to work, not everywhere. If you watch a typical CFD program evolve a solution, you discover that there are many regions where nothing much is happening, yet we spend as much time doing work there as we do where things are really changing. Perhaps AI can help us figure out how to limit this wasted work. \n",

    "We have looked at the evolution of the computers we use to do serious CFD work. In this section, I will show you a very simple (by today's standards) piece of code I wrote about 1975 to solve the axisymmetric flow over an ogive-cylinder body flying at Mach 6. The program uses a solution procedure developed by Robert MacCormack at NASA Ames in 1969. I worked with those researchers for a month back in 1975.\n",

    "From the description of the machines available in 1973 when I started on this project, you can see that the power of the day was really limited. We did not have much memory available, and we had to work within those limits. Working on a big grid of data points in a space-limited machine means we had to work on blocks of grid points and worry about moving blocks around. \n",
    "\n",
    "We did not know it then, but we were preparing ourselves for the future when massively parallel machines would attack our problems and face the same issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the early CFD codes developed used the time-dependent equations, which started off assuming the vehicle was at rest and instantaneously placed in a moving stream of some fluid. The equations caused those initial conditions to evolve into a steady-state solution (we hoped). Various schemes were developed to deal with a fundamental problem with this approach - instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to experiment with an approach to solving high-speed flow over fairly simple 3D vehicles by eliminating the time dependency and removing the terms that required a solution scheme that looked upwind as it evolved - a parabolic set of equations. The scheme was simple enough- selectively eliminate any term that annoyed you and see what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you ended up with was a procedure that could be marched in the axial direction (with the flow) exactly the same way we marched in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my experiments, I used a solution scheme developed by Robert MacCormack in 1969 at NASA Ames. It was called a \"Predictor-Corrector* scheme, still in use today.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used an interesting scheme to avoid looping over the grid twice, once for the predictor step, then again for the corrector step. Instead, I set up a small \"working array\" to store predictor values. As soon as enough of these were available, I processed the corrector step and saved the final result back in memory. The CDC-6600 was a small memory machine, and this really helped!"
